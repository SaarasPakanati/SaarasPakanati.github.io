Hey! I am Saaras Pakanati. I am a Mechanical Engineering Senior at the University of Cincinnati ([Go Bearcats!](https://www.uc.edu/campaigns/points-of-pride.html)), working on multiphase flows.

I am currently interested in exploring computational fluid dynamics and numerical techniques for optimizing simulations, with my current research spanning the experimental and computational evaluation of instabilities in liquid thin films, long-term storage of cryogenic fuels in space, the development of contactless optical methods for spatio-temporal temperature measurement, and surfactant-based control of interfacial phenomena.
